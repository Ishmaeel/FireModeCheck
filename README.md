# FireModeCheck

Immersiveâ„¢ user experience mod for [S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly)

Check the current firing mode of active weapon via a hotkey.
Intended for people who prefer to play with the HUD turned off, or with a minimalist HUD configuration.

Choose from three operation modes:

* **Basic Mode**: Firing mode switch buttons behavior is unchanged from vanilla. New mode is displayed on screen after switching.
* **Dual Key Mode**: <kbd>Previous Firing Mode</kbd> key displays the current mode without switching. <kbd>Next Firing Mode</kbd> key cycles between firing modes.
* **Single Key Mode**: Both hotkeys work in the same way: Single tap for displaying current mode, double tap for switching modes. Helps free up one keybinding.

By default, on-screen firing mode indicator is hidden and the *Single Key Mode* is active. This configuration can be changed via [MCM](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/anomaly-mod-configuration-menu).
